# pcb_power_supply
This repository contains the KiCAD schematic/PCB files for a linear and switching power supply board that can be used to power boards using the template in [this repo](https://github.com/jc-roth/pcb_kicad_template).

## Building/operating the circuit
Either directly download gerber and BOM files from the releases page or download the KiCAD project and export to your liking. Feel free to shoot me an email with any questions.
